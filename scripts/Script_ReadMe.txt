SCRIPT READ ME

This document explains the different scripts written for the final project. Some of these
were for tests or intermediate steps and not used for the final tree, and so the data
associated with them isn't in this repo.

#### K80g ####
This is the revbayes JC model modified for the K80 model of sequence evolution with a 
gamma distribution (alpha=0.05).

#### K80g1 ####
This is the K80g script modified to have 60000 generations instead of the 40000
generations in K80g. I also changed alpha to 0.5 based on the modelgenerator parameters.

#### K80g3 ####
This is the K80g script modified to 100,000 generations.

#### K80g4 ####
This is the K80g script modified to 1,000,000 generations.

#### K80g5 ####
This is the K80g script modified to 500,000 generations and a 20,000 generation burn-in.

#### K80g6 ####
This is the K80g script modified to 1,000,000 generations and a 20,000 generation burn-in.

#### K80g2_Lepus.txt ####
This is the revbayes JC model modified for the K80 model of sequence evolution with a 
gamma distribution (alpha=0.5). The generation time is 40,000 iterations.

#### K80g2_Lepus.txt ####
This is the revbayes JC model modified for the K80 model of sequence evolution with a 
gamma distribution (alpha=0.5). The generation time is 500,000 iterations.
