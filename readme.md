- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

Sporangium anatomy and arrangement of Selaginella (Selaginellaceae) in a phylogenetic context: Distribution of spore discharge techniques

## Introduction and Goals

The release and dispersal of seeds has been widely studied (Cain et al., 2000), but the release and dispersal of spores has received much less attention. This imbalance represents a significant gap in our knowledge of plant biology, because thousands of extant plant species do not produce seeds and rely instead on the dispersal of spores (Ingold, 1939). These plants, which often grow low to the ground, must move their spores above the boundary layer so that they may be carried by the wind. This problem is further complicated by environmental differences (e.g. forests with barriers to wind versus open deserts) that affect wind flow and accordingly the height a spore must attain to penetrate the boundary layer. Subsequently, this lifestyle presents a suite of problems, which many plants have adapted to by developing mechanisms for violent spore release. For example, *Selaginella martensii* can eject a single spore 65cm (~13 times its own height) using a force 23 times greater than that of a human muscle fiber (Schneller et al., 2008).

The *Selaginella* genus is an excellent study group to investigate the diversity and evolution of spore release mechanisms because they span a wide range of environments and exhibit nearly the full range of spore dispersal strategies (Ingold, 1939). *Selaginella* is a member of the lycophytes, or club mosses, and is a diverse clade of ~700 extant species inhabiting ecosystems ranging from deserts to tropical rainforests to temperate forests. Species in Selaginella are heterosporous, meaning that they produce both microspores (small, male) and megaspores (large, female). Heterospory offers the opportunity to examine the mechanisms underlying dehiscence and dispersal of two quite differently sized spores within the same plant. Additionally, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the mechanisms of megaspore dispersal, which have not been adequately documented (Ingold, 1939; Filippini-De Giorgi et al., 1997). *Selaginella* employs a variety of microspore dehiscence mechanisms: some species disperse spores passively, while others actively shoot spores into the air, and still others fling entire spore-filled sporangia as if from a catapult (Koller & Scheckler, 1986). 

The goal of my project is to examine the diversity of megaspore and microspore release mechanisms within *Selaginella* in a phylogenetic and ecological context, ultimately to determine whether spore release mechanisms differ between megaspores and microspores, and whether they vary by major biome and/or clade. 
To answer these questions I will construct a phylogeny of *Selaginella* based on rbcL sequences for the species available in GenBank. I view this part of my final project as an exercise to work on my computational skills rather than as essential to the project; molecular phylogenies of Selaginella have been constructed (e.g. Korall & Kenrick, 2004; Zhou et al., 2015) and I could (and may, depending on the outcome of the phylogeny I construct) ultimately choose to plot the characters I am interested in onto the most recent published phylogeny. I then will plot sporangial arrangement (of megaspores and microspores within the strobilus) and anatomy (different wall thickenings are associated with different discharge mechanisms) on the tree. Data for these characters will come predominantly from the literature (Horner & Arnott, 1963; Somers, 1982; Koller & Scheckler, 1986; Quansah, 1988; Schneller et al., 2008). I will include some of my personal observations and data, should I get the materials to embed and section strobili of the *Selaginella* species that I currently have. However, it is unlikely I will have collected much of my own data by the due date of this project, and accordingly I plan to continually add to the tree I create as I continue to collect data. 

What I described above is the ultimate goal I have for the project. However, I do not currently have the data on these characters that I need to actually run these analyses. Accordingly, for the sake of this class project (which will have to be finshed well before I have the data for the questions I'm actually interested in), I am going to simulate trees and character data. If I have time, I will plug in the sparse real character data that I currently have. (Though it certainly isn't enough to learn anything biologically relevant).
