# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Title of my project
Extinction and the loss of phylogenetic diversity

## Introduction and Goals

It seems inevitable that climate change, along with other anthropogenic factors, will continue to drive the endangerment and extinction of taxa for the immediate future. Each species is by definition a unique parcel of genetic information, which means that an extinction is the loss of a unique genome. With the number of endgangered taxa mounting, it is important to understand the ways in which species will go extinct, and what that means for the loss of phylogenetic diversity. 

The methods I will use to do this are...

My goal is to construct the phylogeny for a widely distributed group of species (exact group pending further research) and map the degree to which each tip node is imperiled onto the phylogeny. With this information, along with a relatedness metric such as  distance between tip node sequence, I hope to observe the pattern of endangerment within the phylogenetic tree (whether it is clustered or uniform), and possibly even which types of genetic information (genes) are most frequently lost. 



The data I will use are (my own data/ data publicly available at YYY/ simulations)

I expect I will draw on data from an existing published phylogeny or collection of published data. I will score degree of endangerment by classification on IUCN red list, though I will look into a continuous variable that describes endangerment.
