# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

# Introgression in *Viburnum*

## Introduction and Goals

The sister species *Viburnum mattii* and *Viburnum oonakatensis* have produced previously identified hybrid swarms, (Donoghue, 1982) but we don't know the level of genetic contribution from the parents to individuals in the swarm. What is the extent of genetic introgression between these two species of *Viburnum*? In this study, I will:

* Test the level of introgression between pure parent populations of *V. mattii* and *V. oonakatensis* (Are the parents truly genetically isolated to begin with?) 

* Test for introgression between parents and hybrids (Do the hybrids show introgression between the parent species?) 

* Test population structure of hybrids (How much of each hybrid's genome comes from one parent versus the other?) 

The level of introgression and clustering of parental genetic contributions within the hybrids will give us a better idea about gene flow from the parental popluation to the hybrid swarm. Knowledge about the genetic contributions of the parents will inform future studies on heritable plant traits.

The data I will use for this analysis are RADseq reads provided by Deren Eaton from plants obtained during a collecting trip in the summer of 2015. I will use pyRAD ([Eaton, 2014](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/13/1844)) to perform contig assembly, tree assembly, and ABBA/BABA testing ([Durand et al., 2011](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/8/2239)) to test for introgression. I will also use Structure ([Pritchard et al., 2000](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/2/945.short)) to look at population structure clustering.
