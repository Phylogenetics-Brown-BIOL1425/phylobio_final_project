# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Tracking 4th Trochanter Position in Ornithischian Dinosaurs 

## Introduction and Goals

The 4th trochanter is a prominent bony process found on the femur of archosaurs, onto which the *M. caudofemoralis longus* and *M. caudofemoralis brevis* muscles insert. The caudofemoralis longus (CFL, for short) is thought to be the most important of the hindlimb retractors, and the main muscle driving archosaur hindlimb locomotion. The morphology of the 4th trochanter reveals important information about the structure and dynamics of the CFL, and is therefore vital when trying to reconstruct the locomotor abilities of extinct archosaurs. Ornithischian dinosaurs display distinctive 4th trochanters; specifically, the trochanters tend to be larger and more distally-positioned than those of other dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The basic principles of muscle dynamics suggest that their CFL musculature would have functioned differently due to their unique morphology, and some researchers have begun to postulate how these differences in function would have affected their ecology. However, any anatomically-based discussion of Ornithischian ecology must take into account the phylogenetic distribution of their characteristic 4th trochanters. So far, no researchers have attempted to track this feature through Ornithischian phylogeny; we hope to do so in this project.
