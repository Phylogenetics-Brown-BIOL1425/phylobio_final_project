# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

##

# Building Phylogeny using Whole Genome Sequencing of various species from the genus drosophila.

## Introduction and Goals

Drsosophilia melanogaster is a model organism of genetics. This has led to a surge of genetic tools that are available to manipulate several species of drosophila for a wealth of different studies. There are several different instituations that caters to scientists that use these models for research. These institutions breed populations of Drosophilia which tend to have some level of polymorphism which can affect complex trait.  

The goal of my project is to answer the question?

Investigate the phylogeny of various Drosophila species from the Drosophila Reference Planel. 

Map gene expression characters to phylogeny tree. 

The methods I will use to do this are...

Still confuse, update later. 

The data I will use are (my own data/ data publicly available at YYY/ simulations)

## Methods

The tools I used were... See analysis files at (links to analysis files).

## Results

## Discussion

These results indicate...

The biggest difficulty in implementing these analyses was...

If I did these analyses again, I would...
