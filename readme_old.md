# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

# Title of my project

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to answer the question, What is...?
One goal of my project is to answer the question, What is the evolutionary history of MHC class II genes in lagomorphs and rodents? 
MHC genes are exceptionally diverse and are often cited as the most polymorphic vertebrate genes. I am especially interested in identifying instances of trans-species maintenance of MHC lineages, which is often detected for MHC genes. Surridge et al. (2008) sequenced the MHC class II gene DQA in 16 different genera of lagomorphs and related their evolutionary history using a neighbor-joining tree. While this yielded novel insight into lagomorph MHC evolution, there are additional sequences from other species and more recent studies that can also be included in the analyses (i.e. Gouy de Bellocq et al. 2009; Koutsogiannouli et al. 2009) and other methods that can be employed. DRB variation in rabbits has been characterized for the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) (Koutsogiannouli et al. 2014) and the genome of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is publically available, but this knowledge is largely lacking for other lagomorphs. Rodentia and Lagomorpha together form the Glires clade (Huchon et al. 2002), and I am interesting in exloring MHC DQA and DRB gene phylogeny in lagomorphs and rodents together. Because European hare MHC DQA genes are well characterized across different areas of Europe (de Bellocq et al. 2009; Koutsogiannouli et al. 2009, I am also interesting in delving deeper into the phylogeography of DQA in this species, perhaps by compiling data across these studies or by employing alternative phylogenetic analyses.

A secondary goal is to learn methods that I will directly apply to my dissertation research.

The methods I will use to do this are...
In general terms, I will construct separate phylogenies for the MHC class II genes DRB and DQA in different lagomorph species, and also including rodent data because rodent MHC genes are generally more well-characterized than rabbit MHC across species. I am also interested in including a more specific analysis of phylogeographic variation in MHC II genes in the European hare.

The data I will use are (my own data/ data publicly available at YYY/ simulations)
I will use data from published studies and available on GenBank. I may also have some of my own preliminary sequencing data available.
