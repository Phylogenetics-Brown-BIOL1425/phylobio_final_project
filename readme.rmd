# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it, develop your project, and submit it as a pull request. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

- Commit and push often as you work.

OK, here we go.

Sensitivity Analysis of EDGE values

## Introduction and Goals

It seems inevitable that climate change, along with other anthropogenic factors, will continue to drive the endangerment and extinction of taxa for the immediate future. Each species is by definition a unique parcel of genetic information, which means that an extinction is the loss of a unique genome. With the number of endgangered taxa mounting, it is important to understand the ways in which species will go extinct, and what that means for the loss of phylogenetic diversity. EDGE values (Isaac et al 2007) are a proposed method of combining a species' probability of extinction with a measure of its unique evolutionary history. Calculation of the evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) value is based on tree topology, where a species' score is  the total branch length from the root node to its tip, where internal branches' weight is scaled by the number of tip taxa that share that branch.

__**The methods I will use to do this are...**__

My goal is to construct the phylogeny for Salamandridae and map EDGE values (evolutionarily distinct, globally endangered) onto the tips.  


__**The data I will use are (my own data/ data publicly available at YYY/ simulations)**__

I am drawing my data entirely from the supplementary table of accession numbers provided in Pyron 2011.

## Methods

I started by downloading the accession numbers for 12 genes published Pyron 2011, used in the construction of a comprehensive Amphibia phylogeny, storing them in a data frame called accessions.  

```{r}
accessions=read.csv("Pyrondata.csv",header = TRUE)
# data is from Pyron 2011
row.names(accessions)=accessions[,1]
specieslist=accessions[,1]
accessions=accessions[-2873,]
accessions=accessions[,-1]
dim(accessions)
accessions[1,]

```
I then downloaded a list of all the IUCN designations for species within Salamandridae from the IUCN Red List database (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), storing it locally as a .csv and within the R environment as IUCN_salamandridae.
```{r}
IUCN_salamandridae=read.csv("IUCN_salamandridae.csv", header = TRUE)
dim(IUCN_salamandridae)
names(IUCN_salamandridae)
row.names(IUCN_salamandridae)=IUCN_salamandridae[,4]
IUCN_salamandridae=IUCN_salamandridae[,-4]
```
By searching the row names of each dataframe, I pared down the rows in accessions so that I only look at species with designations in the IUCN database. This removed about 500 rows from the original Pyron dataset.
```{r}
accessions=accessions[rownames(accessions)%in%rownames(IUCN_salamandridae),]
dim(accessions)
accessions[1,]
```
I then created an IUCN_salamandridae_matched dataframe, which listed only those rows which are in accessions, effectively creating two dataframes with identical rows.
```{r}
IUCN_salamandridae_matched=IUCN_salamandridae[rownames(IUCN_salamandridae)%in%rownames(accessions),]
dim(IUCN_salamandridae_matched)
names(IUCN_salamandridae_matched)
```
I then went into the matched IUCN dataframe and extracted the Red_list_status and Red_list_criteria columns and appended them to my accessions dataframe. 
```{r}
accessions[,13]=IUCN_salamandridae_matched[,7]
accessions[,14]=IUCN_salamandridae_matched[,8]
names(accessions)[13]="Red_list_status"
names(accessions)[14]="Red_list_criteria"
names(accessions)

```
I then exported my accessions dataframe to a .csv file
```{r}
write.csv(accessions,file = "accessions2.csv")
```
