#only requires number of taxa --ultrametric tree 
##taxa with most characters filled in
t <- rcoal( 42 )
plot( t )

##all taxa for tree I made
t <- rcoal( 247 )
plot( t )


##simulating character evolution
sim.char()

##We'll simulate three characters, each with a variance of 1. The fist two characters will have a covariance of 0.7 with each other. The third characters will have a covariance of 0 with the other characters. First, make a variance-covariance matrix describes this relationship:

vcv <- diag( 3 )
vcv[1,2] <- 0.7
vcv[2,1] <- 0.7
vcv

##generate multiple simulated datasets on tree t according to vcv:
library(geiger)
D <- sim.char( t, vcv, nsim = 100, model = "BM", root = 0 )
D[,,1]
library( adephylo )
library( phylobase )
D4 <- phylo4d( t, D[,,1] )
table.phylo4d( D4, box=FALSE )

##independent contrasts 
ic1 <- pic( D[,1,1], t )
ic2 <- pic( D[,2,1], t )
ic3 <- pic( D[,3,1], t )

cov( cbind( ic1, ic2, ic3 ) )

##covariance of values at the tips (not independent contrasts)
cov( cbind( D[,1,1], D[,2,1], D[,3,1] ) )
